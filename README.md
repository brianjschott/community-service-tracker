# community-service-tracker

## Description

This webapp is designed to track students' community service hours over time and allow community-service supervisors to maintain and authorize student records. This app is a learning experience for us so there will likely be some mistakes along the way.

Students should post the hours, which should generate a link that the partner can verify/report, which should then generate a request for an admin to also verify said hours.

Special thanks to my students at my former school, Bronx Academy for Software Engineering, for helping with the concept, design, and coding of this app.
